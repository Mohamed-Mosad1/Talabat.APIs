# Talabat E-commerce Project Overview

# RESTful API
ASP.NET Core Web API
The backbone of the backend, providing a robust and high-performance framework for building RESTful services.

# Architectural Patterns
# Onion Architecture
Onion Architecture: Employed to enforce a clear separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and testability by structuring the application into layers.

# Data Management
# Entity Framework Core
Used as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for data access, enabling efficient and type-safe database operations.
SQL Server: The primary relational database management system used to store and manage application data.
Seeding: Initialized the database with essential data to facilitate development and testing.

# Generic Repository: 
Provides a generic implementation of common CRUD operations, promoting code reuse and simplifying data access.
Repository Pattern: Adds an additional abstraction for data access, enhancing flexibility and testability.
# Unit of Work: 
Manages transactions across multiple repositories, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

# Caching and Performance Optimization
Redis Caching: Implements caching strategies using Redis to enhance performance by reducing database load and speeding up data retrieval.
In-Memory Database: Used for quick access to frequently used data, improving application performance.

# Security and Authentication
ASP.NET Core Identity
Identity Authentication and Authorization: Manages user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the application.
JWT Tokens: Utilized for secure and stateless authentication, allowing users to authenticate and access protected resources.
Login & Register: Implements secure and user-friendly authentication and registration processes.
Forgot and Reset Password: Provides functionality to securely handle forgotten and reset passwords.
Send Email: Integrates email services to send notifications and password reset links to users.

# Data Transfer and Mapping
AutoMapper
Automatically maps objects between different layers (e.g., DTOs to domain models), reducing boilerplate code and ensuring consistency.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Used for transferring data between the client and the server, ensuring only necessary data is exposed.

# Data Operations
CRUD Operations
Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources in the application.

# Advanced Data Handling
# Pagination with Specification Design Pattern: 
Efficiently handles large datasets by dividing them into manageable pages, improving performance and user experience.
# Sorting: 
Adds functionality to sort data based on various criteria, enhancing the user experience by providing organized data.
# Filtering: 
Implements advanced filtering techniques to allow users to refine their search results based on specific parameters.

# Shopping Basket
# Basket Repository
Implements functionality for managing user shopping baskets in memory-database, including adding, removing, and updating items.

# Payment Integration
# Stripe Payment Gateway
Payment with Stripe: Integrates Stripe for secure and efficient payment processing, enabling users to complete transactions seamlessly.
